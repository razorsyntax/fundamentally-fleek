    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      At Fundamentally, privacy is at the core of our mission. We are dedicated
      to protecting your personal information and ensuring it is handled with
      care. We collect only the minimum data necessary for login and user
      management—specifically your name and email—and we are actively exploring
      ways to obfuscate this data, even from ourselves, to further enhance your
      privacy. We do not collect data that identifies you beyond this, and we
      never sell your information.
