      <h2>Service Description</h2>
      <p>
        Fundamentally is a crypto asset research and portfolio management software
        platform that provides analysis tools, scoring systems, and technical
        analysis capabilities. We do not provide financial advice, manage assets,
        allow our users to manage assets, or act as a financial service provider.
        We are not a money transmitter. All analysis and tools are for

      <h2>Platform Status and Nature of Services</h2>
      <p>
        Fundamentally operates exclusively as a research and analysis platform.
        The Platform does not act as a money transmitter, financial intermediary,
        or asset custodian under any applicable laws or regulations. We do not at
        any time hold, custody, manage, or exercise control over any
        cryptocurrency, fiat currency, or other assets belonging to our users. The
        Platform's sole function is to provide analytical tools, data aggregation,
        and information for research purposes. Any investment decisions,
        transactions, or trading activities undertaken by users based on
        information obtained through our Platform are made independently and at
        the user's sole discretion and risk.
      </p>

      <h2>User Conduct and Account Security</h2>
      <h3>Prohibited Activities</h3>
      <p>
        Users of the Platform are strictly prohibited from engaging in any
        activities that compromise or attempt to compromise the security of the
        Platform or the privacy of other users. This includes, but is not limited
        to, any attempts to breach the Platform's security measures, any actions
        that could compromise the confidentiality or integrity of other users'
        data, and any malicious activities that could potentially harm the
        Platform's infrastructure or its user community. The Platform reserves the
        right to terminate access immediately and without prior notice for any
        violations of these security provisions.
      </p>
      <h3>Account Security</h3>
      <p>
        Users bear full responsibility for maintaining the security of their
        account credentials and implementing appropriate security measures to
        protect their access to the Platform. This responsibility includes the
        selection and maintenance of strong passwords and the activation of
        additional security features as they become available on the Platform,
        such as two-factor authentication. In accordance with our commitment to
        user privacy, we do not monitor or restrict account sharing between users,
        nor do we collect personal information that would enable us to verify
        individual account ownership. Users assume all risks associated with their
        chosen account security practices.

      <h2>Liability and Platform Reliability</h2>
      <h3>Service Availability</h3>
      <p>
        While the Platform strives to maintain consistent service availability,
        particularly during core operational hours of 12:00 PM to 9:00 PM Central
        Standard Time (CST), we make no guarantees regarding specific uptime
        percentages or service availability windows. As a developing platform, we
        may experience periodic service interruptions, maintenance requirements,
        or technical difficulties. System updates and maintenance are performed on
        a rolling basis without predetermined maintenance windows, and users
        acknowledge that access to the Platform may be interrupted, suspended, or
        terminated at any time without prior notice.
      </p>
      <h3>Data and Analysis Tools</h3>
      <p>
        The Platform provides analysis tools and data aggregation services using
        information obtained from various sources within our current technical and
        operational capabilities. While we strive to maintain high standards of
        data quality and continually improve our tools and services, we make no
        representations or warranties regarding the accuracy, completeness, or
        reliability of any data, analysis, or information provided through the
        Platform. Users acknowledge that data quality and analytical capabilities
        will evolve over time, and that the Platform's tools and services are
        provided "as is" and "as available." Users are solely responsible for
        independently verifying any information obtained through the Platform and
        assume all risks associated with their use of our tools and services for
        investment or other purposes.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Third-Party Services and Data</h2>
      <p>
        The Platform integrates services and data from various third-party
        providers, including but not limited to CoinGecko for cryptocurrency data,
        TradingView for chart functionality, and CryptoCompare for news
        aggregation. Users acknowledge that the availability and functionality of
        these third-party services are beyond our control and may be subject to
        interruptions, modifications, or termination without notice. The Platform
        bears no responsibility for any disruptions, inconsistencies, or errors
        that may arise from these third-party integrations, including but not
        limited to service outages, API limitations, or modifications to data
        delivery systems. Users acknowledge that the reliability and accuracy of
        third-party data and services cannot be guaranteed, and the Platform shall
        not be liable for any consequences arising from third-party service
        disruptions or data inaccuracies.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Account Management</h2>
      <h3>Data Retention</h3>
      <p>
        Following account cancellation or termination, the Platform maintains user
        data for a period of ninety (90) days. During this retention period, users
        may export their data or request immediate deletion of all account
        information. In the absence of specific user action, all account data will
        be automatically and permanently deleted at the conclusion of the
        retention period. The Platform will provide notification prior to
        permanent data deletion, but assumes no responsibility for data recovery
        after the retention period has expired. Users are strongly encouraged to
        maintain their own records and export any necessary data during the
        retention period.
      </p>
      <h3>Account Ownership</h3>
      <p>
        The Platform does not support official account transfers between users.
        While users may update the email address associated with their account, we
        do not verify personal information or account ownership due to our
        privacy-first approach. Accounts that remain unpaid for a period of three
        (3) months will be automatically terminated, subject to the data retention
        policies outlined herein. The Platform reserves the right to terminate any
        account that violates these Terms or engages in prohibited activities,
        with or without notice.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Communications</h2>
      <p>
        The Platform requires the ability to send payment-related notifications
        and critical service updates to all users with active subscriptions. These
        mandatory communications include, but are not limited to, payment
        confirmations, renewal notices, and payment failure notifications. Beyond
        these essential communications, all other notifications and communications
        are provided on an opt-in basis. The Platform maintains a strict policy
        against unsolicited communications and will not engage in promotional
        messaging without explicit user consent. Users may manage their
        communication preferences through their account settings, with the
        understanding that certain critical notifications cannot be disabled while
        maintaining an active subscription.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Geographic Availability</h2>
      <p>
        The Platform's services are available globally to users who pay with
        cryptocurrency.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Modifications to Terms</h2>
      <p>
        The Platform reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time at its
        sole discretion. Users will be notified of any material changes to these
        Terms via email or through the Platform interface. Continued use of the
        Platform following the posting of modified Terms constitutes acceptance of
        those modifications. If you do not agree with the modified Terms, you must
        immediately discontinue use of the Platform.
