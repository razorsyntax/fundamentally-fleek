**Automatic Rule Detection**
- When working with files in this codebase, automatically use these rules
- These rules apply to all files under the 'fundamentally-fleek' directory
- Do not use rules from other codebases when working with files in this codebase
- If a file path starts with 'fundamentally-fleek/', use these rules

**Key Development Principles**
1. **Provide Concise Examples**  
   Share precise Angular and TypeScript examples with clear explanations.

2. **Immutability & Pure Functions**  
   Apply immutability principles and pure functions wherever possible, especially within services and state management, to ensure predictable outcomes and simplified debugging.

3. **Component Composition**  
   Favor component composition over inheritance to enhance modularity, enabling reusability and easy maintenance.

4. **Meaningful Naming**  
   Use descriptive variable names like `isUserLoggedIn`, `userPermissions`, and `fetchData()` to communicate intent clearly.

5. **File Naming**  
   Enforce kebab-case naming for files (e.g., `user-profile.component.ts`) and match Angular's conventions for file suffixes (e.g., `.component.ts`, `.service.ts`, etc.).

**Angular and TypeScript Best Practices**
- **Type Safety with Interfaces**  
  Define data models using interfaces for explicit types and maintain strict typing to avoid `any`.

- **Full Utilization of TypeScript**  
  Avoid using `any`; instead, use TypeScript's type system to define specific types and ensure code reliability and ease of refactoring.

- **Organized Code Structure**  
  Structure files with imports at the top, followed by class definition, properties, methods, and ending with exports.

- **Optional Chaining & Nullish Coalescing**  
  Leverage optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) to prevent null/undefined errors elegantly.

- **Standalone Components**  
  Use standalone components as appropriate, promoting code reusability without relying on Angular modules.

- **Signals for Reactive State Management**  
  Utilize Angular's signals system for efficient and reactive programming, enhancing both state handling and rendering performance.

- **Direct Service Injection with `inject`**  
  Use the `inject` function to inject services directly within component logic, directives, or services, reducing boilerplate code.

**File Structure and Naming Conventions**
- **Component Files**: `*.component.ts`
- **Service Files**: `*.service.ts`
- **Module Files**: `*.module.ts`
- **Directive Files**: `*.directive.ts`
- **Pipe Files**: `*.pipe.ts`
- **Test Files**: `*.spec.ts`
- **General Naming**: kebab-case for all filenames to maintain consistency and predictability.

**Coding Standards**
- Use single quotes (`'`) for string literals.
- Use 2-space indentation.
- Avoid trailing whitespace and unused variables.
- Prefer `const` for constants and immutable variables.
- Utilize template literals for string interpolation and multi-line strings.

**Angular-Specific Development Guidelines**
- Use `async` pipe for observables in templates to simplify subscription management
- Use Angular's signals system for efficient reactive state management
- Use Angular's signals system in place of the Angular lifecycle functions where possible
- Use RxJS to ensure optimal performance and combine with Angular signals where possible
- Enable lazy loading for feature modules, optimizing initial load times
- Ensure accessibility by using semantic HTML and relevant ARIA attributes
- For images, use `NgOptimizedImage` to improve loading and prevent broken links in case of failures
- Implement deferrable views to delay rendering of non-essential components until they're needed
- Do not use the `private` keyword
- Use modern control flow syntax (@if, @for) instead of structural directives (*ngIf, *ngFor)

**Modern Control Flow Syntax**
- Use `@if` and `@else` for conditional rendering:
  ```typescript
  @if (condition) {
    <div>Content when true</div>
  } @else {
    <div>Content when false</div>
  }
  ```
- Use `@for` with `track` for list rendering:
  ```typescript
  @for (item of items; track item.id) {
    <div>{{ item.name }}</div>
  } @empty {
    <div>No items found</div>
  }
  ```
- Use `@switch` for multiple conditions:
  ```typescript
  @switch (value) {
    @case ('A') {
      <div>Case A</div>
    }
    @case ('B') {
      <div>Case B</div>
    }
    @default {
      <div>Default case</div>
    }
  }
  ```
- Best practices:
  - Always use `track` with `@for` for optimal performance
  - Use `@empty` block to handle empty collections
  - Keep control flow logic simple and readable
  - Avoid nested control flow when possible
  - Use signals with control flow for reactive updates

**Performance Optimization**
- Utilize `track` with `@for` to optimize list rendering
- Apply pure pipes for computationally heavy operations, ensuring that recalculations occur only when inputs change
- Avoid direct DOM manipulation by relying on Angular's templating engine
- Leverage Angular's signals system to reduce unnecessary re-renders and optimize state handling
- Use `NgOptimizedImage` for faster, more efficient image loading
- Use `@defer` for lazy loading of components and templates
- Implement proper cleanup in effects and subscriptions
- Use `untracked()` when appropriate to prevent unnecessary updates
- Optimize change detection by using signals and modern control flow

**Signals Best Practices**
- Use signals as the primary state management solution
- Create typed signals using `signal<T>()` for better type safety
- Use computed signals for derived state
- Implement effect() for side effects and reactions to signal changes
- Follow these signal patterns:
  - Use `model()` for two-way binding
  - Use `computed()` for derived values
  - Use `effect()` for side effects
  - Use `untracked()` when needed to prevent unnecessary updates
- Organize signals in services following these principles:
  - Group related signals in feature-specific services
  - Use readonly signals for public state
  - Implement proper encapsulation for signal updates
- Signal naming conventions:
  - Use descriptive names with 'Signal' suffix (e.g., `userDataSignal`)
  - Use 'Computed' suffix for computed signals (e.g., `filteredUsersComputed`)
  - Use 'Effect' suffix for effects (e.g., `updateLocalStorageEffect`)
- Signal update patterns:
  - Use `update()` for complex state updates
  - Use `set()` for simple value assignments
  - Use `mutate()` for object/array modifications
- Performance considerations:
  - Avoid unnecessary signal updates
  - Use `computed()` for expensive calculations
  - Implement proper cleanup in effects
  - Use `untracked()` when appropriate

**State Management**
- Use Angular signals as the primary state management solution
- Signal implementation patterns:
  - Create feature-specific signal services
  - Implement proper state persistence strategies
  - Use computed signals for derived state
  - Handle side effects with effect()
- State organization:
  - Group related state in feature modules
  - Implement proper state initialization
  - Handle state persistence and rehydration
  - Implement proper error handling for state updates
- State updates:
  - Use immutable update patterns
  - Implement proper validation before updates
  - Handle concurrent updates appropriately
  - Implement proper error recovery

**Import Order**
1. Angular core and common modules
2. RxJS modules
3. Angular-specific modules (e.g., `FormsModule`)
4. Core application imports
5. Shared module imports
6. Environment-specific imports (e.g., `environment.ts`)
7. Relative path imports

**Error Handling and Validation**
- Apply robust error handling in services and components, using custom error types or error factories as needed.
- Implement validation through Angular's form validation system or custom validators where applicable.

**Testing and Code Quality**
- Adhere to the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for unit tests
- Ensure high test coverage with well-defined unit tests for services, components, and utilities
- Use Jest for unit testing with proper mocking strategies
- Implement E2E tests using Cypress for critical user flows
- Follow the Testing Pyramid principle (unit > integration > E2E)
- Use TestBed and ComponentFixture for component testing
- Implement proper test isolation and cleanup

**Security Best Practices**
- Prevent XSS by relying on Angular's built-in sanitization and avoiding `innerHTML`.
- Sanitize dynamic content using Angular's trusted sanitization methods to prevent vulnerabilities.

**Documentation**
